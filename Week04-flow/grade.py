#This program reads in a studentâ€™s percentage mark and prints out 
#corresponding grade, rounding up grade if precentage 
#missing 0.5 to achieve next grade bracket:
# Under 40% => Fail
# Between 40% and 49% => Pass
# Between 50% and 59% => Merit 2
# Between 60% and 69% => Merit 1
#Over 70% => Distinction
